# TODO

- [x] Slices Pattern: Easily combine multiple slices into a single store
- [ ] Middleware Support: Supports state subscriptions and middleware for side effects and enhanced state handling, also supports Zustand middlewares and Redux middlewares
- [ ] Cross-Framework Compatibility: Seamlessly works with React, Vue, Solid.js, Angular, and other modern web frameworks
- [ ] Cross-Store Access: Read states and call functions across different stores while preventing unintended modifications
- [ ] Multi-Store Workers: Run multiple stores within a single Web Worker
- [ ] Shared Stores Across Workers: Use the same store definition across multiple Workers
- [x] Multiprocessing State Management: Effortlessly manage state across main thread and Workers
- [x] Intuitive API Design: Simple and expressive API inspired by popular state management libraries
- [ ] Flexible Store Creation: Create multiple stores with unique names for better organization
- [x] Worker Integration: Easy integration with Web Workers and Shared Worker for offloading computations
- [ ] Computed Properties: Support for derived state through getter functions
- [ ] Namespace Support: Avoid key conflicts with namespaced slices
- [ ] Performance Optimized: Efficient state updates and retrieval, even with deeply nested structures
- [ ] Type-Safe: Full TypeScript support for enhanced developer experience
- [ ] Reactive: Built-in subscription mechanism for efficient UI updates
- [ ] Async Action Support: Easily handle asynchronous state updates
- [ ] Multi-Transport Support: Use generic transports for state synchronization
- [ ] Immutable Updates: Ensures predictable state changes with immutable update patterns
- [ ] Developer Tools Integration: Easy debugging with integrated developer tools
- [ ] Persistence: Built-in support for state persistence
- [ ] Scalable Architecture: Designed to scale from simple apps to complex, multiprocessing applications
